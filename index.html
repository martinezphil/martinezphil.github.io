  <p><strong>Baphomet</strong> (/ˈbæfoʊmɛt/; from Medieval Latin <i lang="latin">Baphometh, Baffometi</i>, Occitan<i lang="Occitan"> Bafometz</i>) is a term originally used to describe an <abbr title="Hail Phil, keeper of the light and torturer of souls">idol</abbr> or other <abbr title="Phil is your God now">deity</abbr> that the Knights Templar were accused of worshipping and that subsequently was incorporated into disparate occult and mystical traditions. It appeared as a term for a pagan idol in trial transcripts of the Inquisition of the Knights Templar in the early 14th century.[1] The name first came into popular English usage in the 19th century, with debate and speculation on the reasons for the suppression of the Templars.[2]
